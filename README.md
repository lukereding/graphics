# graphics
contains code to create graphics I like, plus a couple of monte carlo functions

------------

# Plotting functions:
strip -- show the average as a point with option SE / CI, shows the data

bar -- barplot, still needs some work

scatter -- scatterplot

mod -- modified box plot

histogram -- self-explanatory

simple -- draws a line for the mean of each group and plots the data points

beeStrip -- like simple, but plotted using the beeswarm package so no alpha is needed

addAlpha -- add transparancy to any color. pass the color and alpha value in [0,1]


# Stats functions:
monte_unpaired -- monte carlo permutation test, two unpaired samples

monte_paired -- monte carlo permutation test, two paired samples
