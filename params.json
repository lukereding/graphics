{"name":"Graphics","tagline":"contains code to create graphics I like","body":"# graphics\r\n## luke reding\r\n\r\nThe graphic.R code in this repository contains a bunch of functions to create graphics with defaults that meet my needs. Some of these are plots that have poor implementation in R while others are wrappers for R graphing functions with defaults that I personally like. There are a couple of general stats functions for doing monte carlo permutation tests for two samples (paired and unpaired) as well. Below I run though the functions and the types of graphs they produce.\r\n\r\nNote that sourcing the `graphics.R` script will download all necessary packages needed.\r\n\r\n## simple\r\nThe simple() function takes your data ass a list, with each element of the list corresponding to a different group you'd like to plot. It plots each data point for each group and draws a line for the mean. Its arguments are:\r\n      \r\n        function (data, lab = rep(c(), length(data)), point_size = 1.2, line_color = \"red\", line_width = 3, jitter = T, point_col = \"#00000080\", y_limits = c(min(unlist(data), na.rm = T), max(unlist(data),na.rm = T)), median = FALSE, rug = TRUE, sample_size = T,IQR = F, ...) \r\n\r\n**Explanations for some of the more esoteric arguments:**\r\n\r\n`lab` : x-axis labels\r\n`jitter` : logical. should the data points be 'jittered' to avoid overplotting?\r\n`rug` : logical. should a rug plot be included on the left-hand side of the plot? Colors for the rug plot are the same as the colors of the groups, but some transparency is added to avoid overplotting\r\n`sample_size` : logical. should the sample size be written above the x-axis under each group?\r\n`IQR` : logical. should a vertical line for the inter-quartile range be plotted as well? Making this true and median = T gives the reader of the graph all the information they would have when looking at a boxplot, plus the actual data.\r\n\r\n**Examples**\r\n\r\n              simple(x,main=\"simple() defaults\")\r\n![](https://github.com/lukereding/graphics/blob/master/examplePlots/simpleDefalts.png)\r\n\r\n     simple(list(rnorm(50,50,5),rnorm(30,40,6),rnorm(10,60,2),rnorm(60,50,10),rnorm(30,39,4)),point_col=wes_palette(5, name = \"Zissou\"),line_color=\"black\",median=T,main=\"simple() dressed up\",xlab=\"groups\",ylab=\"response\",lab=c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"e\"))\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukereding/graphics/master/examplePlots/simpleDressedUp.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
